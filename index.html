                <h2>Broom of the Witching Hour</h2>
                <p>
                    When I was six years old, in a <code>quiet town</code> surrounded by the back of our house, I experienced a chilling encounter 
                    that still sends shivers down my spine. It was an ordinary morning, the world bathed in pre-dawn shadows.
                    I woke up unusually early, the unsettling feeling that something wasn't right lingering in the air.

                <p>
                    As I lay in bed, straining my ears, an eerie sound reached me—a rhythmic sweeping, echoing from the backyard. 
                    Confused and curious, I crept out of my room, following the haunting noise. The moonlight revealed a cloaked 
                    figure, hunched over and sweeping the yard with an old broom.

                <p>
                    <code>Fear</code> gripped me as I watched the mysterious sweeper. The figure, hidden in shadows, seemed to sense my presence. 
                    The sweeping stopped, and the figure turned toward me, a bony hand pointing in my direction. Paralyzed, I could 
                    only watch as the sweeping resumed, the figure fading into the night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Retreating to my room, I pulled the covers tight, <code>haunted</code> by the memory. The backyard, once a place of joy, now 
                    held a lingering unease. The rhythmic sweeping, the pointed finger—it was a horror etched into my childhood, a 
                    mysterious visitor in the silent hours before dawn.

                <h2>The Phantom Hourglass: A Decade of Midnight Terrors - My Ten-Year-Old Encounter with Sleep Paralysis</h2>
                <p>
                    When I was just ten, a <code>peculiar night</code> unfolded in my bedroom. I awoke to find myself stuck in sleep paralysis. 
                    The moon's gentle glow illuminated the room, setting the stage for a disquieting episode.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unable to move, I felt an <code>unusual weight</code> on my chest, as if an invisible force held me down. In the faint light, 
                    a shadowy figure materialized, advancing towards me. Strange whispers filled the air, adding to the sense of unease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the figure loomed, the paralysis gradually released its hold. With effort, I regained control, and the spectral 
                    presence faded away. Alone in the moonlit room, I grappled with the blurred line between dreams and reality, left with a 
                    lasting impression of that unsettling night. The memory lingered, a reminder of the mysterious realms that come alive when 
                    the night falls silent.
